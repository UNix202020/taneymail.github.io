One of the best things about the online Software Engineering program is that it's possible to learn while you work a day job. I chose the part-time, remote option because I wanted to be able to learn everything at a reasonable pace, yet still needed to keep working to support myself. I tend to do most of my work on the weekends, take a day or two off, and then start working again in the evenings. I came up with a few ideas for how to stay on track learning with a full-time job, and wanted to share them in case they might be helpful:

1) Use your commute time to read lessons or watch videos on your phone. I've been commuting about 45 minutes each way in the mornings and evenings using public transit, and I do try to make use of this time to learn. It's not always easy to concentrate, but everything can be reviewed later. Repeated exposure to new information helps to make learning easier.

2) Set an alarm on your phone so you don't get hopelessly distracted in the evenings- it's easy to get side-tracked, especially around dinner time- and then before you know it, it's time to sleep. I've found that setting an alarm is a perfect solution to this problem.

3) Use blue light blocking glasses to prevent eye strain. If you're on the computer all day for work, it can be unappealing to come home and put in another 2-3 hours in front of the screen again. Blue light blockers can help you avoid eye strain- and possibly even fall asleep better, since blue light can keep you up at night. I found a nice pair online for under $10.

4) Schedule time to play with your cat or dog so that it doesn't interfere with study time. I set another alarm on my phone to cue my cat to when it's play time- we do 10 minutes of interactive play with the laser light, and then it's back to studying after a 2nd alarm goes off. This way she knows when to expect my full attention, and I don't have to worry about her meowing and nagging me about it. We are both happy so far with this arrangement.

5) If you do have a cat, catnip also helps to calm them down after a play period, and they will mellow out and you can concentrate. For dogs, I would probably play with them earlier in the day and tire them out so that by the time you're ready to study they're in snoozing mode. 

6) Sometimes it helps to have pleasant background noise- a favorite movie or music. Complete silence can be ironically distracting for some people. I'm sure this is different for everybody.

7) Keep a checklist of what should be completed this week- and use it as a visual reminder of how much you've accomplished and what still need to be done. I keep one on a sticky note on my desktop.

8) Reward yourself for getting through the week! Sunday nights make a great time to treat yourself, but you could celebrate mid-week, also. Just figure out what works for you!

So those are my thoughts on how to study Software Engineering while working full-time. I hope you found at least a few of these helpful!
