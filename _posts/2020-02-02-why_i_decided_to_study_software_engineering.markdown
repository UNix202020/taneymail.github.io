I decided to study programming because I wanted to upskill an interest into a career. 

My journey of learning how to code has been somewhat of a surprise- In college I got a quick glimpse of coding in a general computer science class, and thought it was incredibly intimidating... and NOT something I could ever do. I studied art, graphic design, and liberal arts, instead. 

Then about seven years ago, I started experimenting with drag-and-drop websites... and that provoked my curiosity about HTML, CSS, and coding. I've been able to learn a lot with free online resources, but am now very excited to go further with Flatiron's curriculum.
